- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rusty-Gopher-Phoenix-Nest
- 👀 I’m interested in web frameworks in all different languages but mostly: Rust, Go, Elixir and NestJs on JavaScript...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and Go (I have to stop buying more training!!)
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything because I have too many projects already...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
