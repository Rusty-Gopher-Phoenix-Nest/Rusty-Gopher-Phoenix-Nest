- 👋 Hi, I’m @GASMan
- 👀 I’m interested in web frameworks in all different languages but mostly back to .Net and Svelte...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SvelteKit 1 and Skeleton/Tailwind (I have to stop buying more training!!)
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything because I have too many projects already...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
